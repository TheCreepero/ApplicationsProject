(If possible): Ability to modify transaction data (this feature is in place for users and accounts in the options menu, that can be used as an example)
Graphical design (mostly done)
Testing (mostly done)
Making the app crash-proof (try-catch, error messages, etc...) MOSTLY IMPLEMENTED
Deleting a user should also delete transactions made on the user account (or ask the admin if they should be deleted)
